# Why we’re building this

- Every day the bank’s card-switch ledger produces millions of authorizations, while Visa and RuPay clear and settle those same transactions in their own daily files.
- Even a single mismatch is potential revenue leakage or a compliance breach.
- The new Two-Way Reconciliation Engine Two-Way Reconciliation Engine closes that gap by automatically ingesting both
  feeds, matching them with hash-plus-fuzzy logic, and surfacing any discrepancies for rapid resolution.
- In short, it turns reconciliation from a nightly fire-drill into an
  auditable, SLA-backed service that keeps money and trust intact
